Project Visualizer and Resource Management

The purpose of this tool is to take the fundementals of Data visualization and apply them to project data. 

Every project stakeholder wants to know "What is the team working on?". Despite the simple question, the answer is often complex and muddled, that is because this is often multiple questions wrapped up in one. 

Questions like: 
"In the next sprint, what is the team spending the most time on?"
"What is the team working on today?"
"What type of requests is the team receiving?"

The only way to answer "what is the team working on?" is to convey data, often a lot of data. An inconvenient amount of data to write or talk through in a meeting, that's why it needs to be visualized. 


Future Improvements/bug fixes:

1. Fix Dates - Completed
2. Label Columns
3. Currently user stories are only added to top of columns. They need to be added to first open space they have room. I think this will require looping through Divs to calculate open space.
4. Color user stories by feature.
5. toggle a visual indication of user story dependencies, like excel's formula validation option.
6. Make a new "sprint window" when user stories height exceeds top.
