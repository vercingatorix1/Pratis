Project Visualizer and Resource Management

The purpose of this tool is to take the fundementals of Data visualization and apply them to project data. 

Every project stakeholder wants to know "What is the team working on?". Despite the simple question, the answer is often complex and muddled, that is because this is often multiple questions wrapped up in one. 

Questions like: 
"In the next sprint, what is the team spending the most time on?"
"What is the team working on today?"
"What type of requests is the team receiving?"

The only way to answer "what is the team working on?" is to convey data, often a lot of data. An inconvenient amount of data to write or talk through in a meeting, that's why it needs to be visualized.
